When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   It will be stored "in the cloud" so I will not have to worry about files getting deleted accidentally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   This is because you can decide when to pull changes, rather than blindly syncing, even when there's no change to the files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used when you want to copy a repository of another user on Github and work on your own version.
    Clones are used when you want to copy a version of a user's repository onto your local machine.
    Branches are used to create different versions of the file on the local machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The advantages of having a copy of the last known state of the remote is that you can easily revert back to it, if needed.
