What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a storage for git commits. To commit changes it is necessary.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a "midpoint" between the working directory and the repository. The working directory has files that are separate from git 
repositories, and the repository is the storage area for git commits. I think the staging area helps to group and visualize which files in the 
working directory should be moved together to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Move the files onto the staging area and use git diff to compare the working directory to staging area. then commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
If you want to make different versions of the same program without any logical changes, branches are helpful because they can function as multiple
different "versions" for the original program.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams help visualization by showing the branches and reachability of every commit.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
The result of merging the two branches together is that it adds lines of code and subtracts lines of code and seamlessly integrates the two branches
together, resulting in a final program. The diagram is helpful in understanding how this works because of branches and merging is a visual concept.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
